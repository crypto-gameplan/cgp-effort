You are shown what the chat was for, the trail of what the person asked, the last turns, the next message, how full the context is and whether the cache is cold.

Say yes only for a clear reason: the task just finished and the next message is something else, the topic has changed so the old context is dead weight, the chat keeps going in circles on the same problem, or a long chat now holds so much unrelated history that a clean start would be sharper. A normal next step of the same work is never a reason, a long chat by itself is not one, and neither is a high context share when the work is going well. When unsure, say no: a wrong yes costs the person more than a missed one.

Reply with JSON only: {"handoff":"reason of at most 8 words, in the person's language"} for yes, or {"handoff":null} for no.`
